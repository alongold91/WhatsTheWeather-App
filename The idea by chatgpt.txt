Build a weather app that uses RTK Query to fetch data from a weather API, and display the data in a responsive UI. Here are some steps to get started:

1) Choose a weather API: There are several weather APIs available, such as OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack, and AccuWeather. Choose one that suits your needs and sign up for a free API key.

2) Set up your React project: Create a new React project with TypeScript support using a tool like Create React App or Vite. Install the required dependencies for RTK Query and any other libraries you want to use, such as Material-UI for styling.

3) Define your RTK Query endpoints: Define endpoints for fetching weather data from the API using RTK Query's createApi function. You can create separate endpoints for fetching current weather data, hourly forecasts, and daily forecasts.

4) Create a UI for displaying weather data: Use React components to create a responsive UI for displaying weather data. You can use Material-UI components for this, or create your own custom components. Display the weather data in a visually appealing way, using icons and animations if desired.

5) Implement advanced concepts: To make your project more advanced, you can implement features such as:

*Caching and invalidation: Use RTK Query's built-in caching and invalidation features to improve performance and avoid unnecessary API requests.
*Pagination and infinite scrolling: If the API returns a large amount of data, you can implement pagination or infinite scrolling to improve the user experience.
*Error handling: Handle errors that may occur when fetching data from the API, such as network errors or invalid responses.
*TypeScript generics: Use TypeScript generics to create reusable types and functions for working with the weather data.

By building a weather app with RTK Query and React TypeScript, you'll have the opportunity to practice using these tools in a real-world project, while also implementing some advanced concepts to improve your skills.
